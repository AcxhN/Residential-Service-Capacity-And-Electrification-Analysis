conclusion
- 
Phase 1: excel 
- learned how to calculate load, and stuff, never knew about demand factor and basic things like service demand 

Phase 2: Rivet 
things i learned 
- learned how to use rivet: importing architecural to electrical file 
- learned to download libaries from autodesk for revit 2026 
- placing components 
- analyze, space, room bounding 
- creating circuit by connecting electric system components to panel 
- creating panel schedule 
- took a long time but got:
    - Proper electrical template
    - Single-phase residential panel
    - Circuits assigned
    - Panel schedule generated
    - Loads appearing
- space
- distrubution system with panel 
- keywords: MEP, electric range
- extenstion for future: learn how to use proper electrical components instead of duplicating receptacles and changing their names and loads, use residential accuray panel 
- things to look into that i had trouble with: hosting and why families can't be placed (Revit can't place family no valid host), when creating a circuit what makes a power connector incompatiabile with system classificaiton, distribution systems (voltage/phase compabtibility) (Revit panel distribution system dropdown empty)

Phase 3: autoCAD
