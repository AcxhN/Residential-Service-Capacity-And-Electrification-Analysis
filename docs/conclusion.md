# Conclusion

## Project Overview
- Residential electrification feasibility portfolio project
- Focused on service sizing, major load identification, and electrical documentation workflow
- Simulated transition from gas to electric systems in a single-family residential home

---

## Phase 1 – Excel Load Calculations
- Learned how to calculate connected load and demand load
- First exposure to demand factors and residential service demand calculations
- Understood difference between connected load vs service demand
- Determined recommended service size based on diversified load
- Developed structured load summary table for major appliances
- Built foundation for electrical service justification

---

## Phase 2 – Revit Electrical Modeling
- Learned Revit MEP workflow from scratch
- Imported architectural model into electrical template
- Downloaded and installed Autodesk Revit 2026 libraries
- Placed electrical components including:
  - Electric range
  - Dryer
  - Heat pump
  - Water heater
  - Lighting and small appliance loads
- Created circuits by assigning electrical systems to a residential panel
- Generated panel schedule with calculated loads
- Configured:
  - Proper electrical template
  - Single-phase residential distribution system
  - Panel with assigned circuits
  - Loads visible in panel schedule
- Gained exposure to:
  - Room bounding and space tools
  - Distribution systems and voltage/phase compatibility
  - System classification and connector compatibility
  - Revit hosting limitations and family placement errors

### Technical Challenges Encountered
- Revit family hosting errors ("No valid host")
- Power connector incompatibility with system classification
- Distribution system configuration issues (panel dropdown empty)
- Lack of accurate residential panel families in default libraries
- Temporary workaround using duplicated receptacles with adjusted parameters

---

## Phase 3 – AutoCAD Electrical Documentation (Planned Extension)
- Translate Revit model into clean 2D electrical plan sheet
- Create structured layer system (ELEC-DEVICE, ELEC-PANEL, ELEC-TEXT, ELEC-ANNO)
- Develop load summary table aligned with Excel results
- Produce simplified one-line/riser diagram
- Generate professional plotted PDF suitable for portfolio presentation
- Improve documentation clarity and industry-style drafting standards

---

## Future Extensions
- Replace placeholder components with manufacturer-accurate residential panel families
- Implement proper residential load calculation standards (CEC/NEC-based refinement)
- Explore feeder sizing and conductor sizing analysis
- Add short-circuit and voltage drop evaluation
- Develop permit-style electrical sheet set
- Expand project to include EV charger integration
- Compare 100A vs 200A service upgrade scenarios
- Integrate cost estimation and utility upgrade implications

---

## Key Takeaways
- Developed foundational understanding of residential electrical service design
- Learned practical workflow across Excel, Revit MEP, and documentation planning
- Strengthened problem-solving skills through troubleshooting Revit system constraints
- Gained exposure to real-world electrical consulting workflow
- Built a portfolio-ready project demonstrating electrification analysis and system modeling
