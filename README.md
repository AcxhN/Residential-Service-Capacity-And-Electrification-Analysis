# Residential Service Capacity Assessment

## Project Overview

This project evaluates whether a typical 100A residential home can transition toward electrification and partial net-zero operation without requiring a service upgrade

The study simulates consulting workflow by combining:

- Electrical load calculations (Excel)
- BIM spatial modeling (Revit)
- ~~Technical documentation drafting (AutoCAD)~~

## Objective

Answer the core engineering question:

> Can a gas-heated residential home transition to electrification (heat pump + heat pump water heater) without exceeding a 100A service capacity?

## Learning Goals

- Apply Canadian Electrical Code residential load calculations
- Evaluate service capacity impacts of electrification
- Model electrical distribution components in Revit
- Produce single-line diagrams in AutoCAD
- Document engineering workflow using Git

## Tools Used

- Excel (load calculations)
- Revit (electrical layout + panel workflow)
- ~~AutoCAD (single-line diagrams)~~ 
- Git (version control + documentation)
